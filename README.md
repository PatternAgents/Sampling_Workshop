Audio Synthesis and Digital Sampling Workshop
=============================================
As someone who was able to work on several of the very first generation of sampling musical instruments, 
and digitial drum machines, I have some historical perspectives and stories around samplers and the musical instrument industry in general. 
This Workshop will cover the history and theory of audio signal generation, and digtial audio sampling, followed by some Hand's On labs where we'll work with
some audio generation and digital audio sampling tools.

**Workshop Objectives :**

+ Understand Audio Signal Generation and Parameters
+ Understand Digital Sampling and Wave Table Generation
+ Understand Audio Signal Generation and Digital Sampling Tools

**Workshop Length :**
+ One Hour for Introduction/Overview
+ One Hour to Three Hours for Hand's On Labs
+ Total : 2 to 4 hours
